# storm-watch
A visualization project that reports on weather events in the United States from 1970 to 2024. 

Unveiling My Latest Data Visualization Project: A 6-page Exploration of Weather Events & Carbon Emissions in the USA! 🌱

I leveraged the power of AWS Cloud Services to analyze and visualize weather events across the United States from 1970 to July 2024. 📊

🔍 What’s Inside the Dashboard?
Overview Page: A summary of storm events, including:
Most frequent storm types (presented in a word cloud 🌪️).
Impacts on life and property (direct/indirect injuries, deaths, property damages).
States most affected by storms and the overall timeline of storm occurrences.

Drill-Down Pages: Detailed insights into:
Flooding, Wildfires, Tornadoes, and Thunderstorms, with key insights like:
States with the highest occurrences.
Seasonal trends for each event type.

Carbon Emissions Page:
Analyzed trends in carbon emissions from 1970 to 2024, using data from the Energy Information Administration (1970-2022) and projections for 2023-2024 based on past trends.
A state-by-state breakdown of annual emissions.
